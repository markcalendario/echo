# **Full Setup Guide**

This guide walks you through setting up the client, server, database, and NGINX for streaming. Follow the steps carefully to ensure everything is configured correctly.

---

## **1. Client Setup (Frontend)**

The client is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the backend. This step installs dependencies and starts the development server.

```bash
cd client
npm install  # Installs all necessary frontend dependencies
npm run dev  # Starts the client development server at a local address
```

---

## **2. Server Setup (Backend)**

The server handles business logic, API requests, and database operations. This step installs backend dependencies and starts the server.

```bash
cd ../server
npm install  # Installs all backend dependencies required for the API
npm run dev  # Starts the backend development server to process requests
```

---

## **3. MySQL Database Setup**

### **Push the Prisma Schema to the Database**

Prisma is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with MySQL. This command ensures the database schema is correctly structured based on the defined models.

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:dev
```

âœ… **What this does:**

- Creates the database if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Generates tables and columns based on the Prisma schema.
- Applies any pending migrations.

### **Generate Prisma Client**

The Prisma client is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that provides an intuitive way to query the database.

```bash
npm run prisma:generate:dev
```

âœ… **What this does:**

- Creates an optimized Prisma client for querying the database.
- Improves developer experience with autocompletion and type safety.

## **4. NGINX Setup for RTMP & HLS Streaming**

NGINX is used as a media server to handle live streaming. The RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) module allows streaming video, and HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) enables adaptive playback.

### **Install NGINX with RTMP Module**

This step installs NGINX along with the RTMP module, which is required for handling live video streams.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp -y
```

### **Modify the NGINX Configuration**

NGINX needs to be configured to support RTMP streaming. This command opens the main configuration file for editing.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

âœ… **What to do next:**

- Append the RTMP settings from `configs/nginx/nginx.conf` into this file.
- Save and exit the editor.

### **Enable HLS Configuration**

HLS is required for smooth and adaptive streaming. This step copies the necessary configuration file to the correct location.

```bash
cp configs/nginx/echo.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/echo.conf
```

âœ… **What this does:**

- Adds HLS streaming support to the NGINX server.
- Ensures video playback works across various devices and network conditions.

### **Restart NGINX to Apply Changes**

Once the configurations are in place, restarting NGINX ensures that the settings take effect.

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

âœ… **What this does:**

- Reloads the updated NGINX configuration.
- Starts handling RTMP and HLS streams immediately.

# **Learning Section: Understanding RTMP and HLS Streaming**

Live streaming involves capturing video from a source (such as a webcam or screen recording), encoding it, and transmitting it over the internet for playback. Two key technologies that make this possible are **RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)** and **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**.

---

## **1. What is RTMP?**

RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is a low-latency streaming protocol designed to efficiently transmit audio, video, and data over the internet. Originally developed by Macromedia (now Adobe), RTMP was widely used for live streaming before transitioning into a protocol mainly for delivering content to media servers.

### **How RTMP Works**

1. A live streaming software (e.g., OBS Studio, vMix, Wirecast) **captures** video and audio from a source.
2. The software **encodes** the video using a codec like H.264 and compresses the audio (e.g., AAC).
3. The encoded stream is sent via RTMP to an **RTMP server** (e.g., NGINX with RTMP module).
4. The RTMP server **distributes** the stream to viewers or converts it into another format like HLS for broader compatibility.

âœ… **Why RTMP?**

- Low latency (~2-5 seconds delay)
- Stable, persistent connection
- Compatible with various streaming software

ðŸš¨ **Limitations**

- Not natively supported on most modern browsers (requires conversion to HLS or DASH)

---

## **2. What is HLS?**

HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is a streaming protocol developed by Apple that is optimized for playback across different devices, including web browsers, smartphones, and smart TVs. It is widely used today for live and on-demand streaming.

### **How HLS Works**

1. The RTMP stream from the broadcaster is received by the **RTMP server** (e.g., NGINX with the RTMP module).
2. The RTMP server **transcodes** and segments the video into small chunks (usually 2-10 seconds each).
3. These chunks are stored as `.ts` (Transport Stream) files, and an `.m3u8` playlist file is created.
4. The `.m3u8` file is served over HTTP, allowing users to stream the video via web browsers and media players.

âœ… **Why HLS?**

- Works on almost all devices and browsers
- Supports adaptive bitrate streaming (automatically adjusts video quality based on internet speed)
- More scalable for larger audiences

ðŸš¨ **Limitations**

- Higher latency (~10-30 seconds delay) compared to RTMP
- Requires additional processing power for conversion

---

## **3. How Streaming Software Connects to an RTMP Server**

Streaming software like OBS Studio, vMix, or Wirecast is used to send live video streams to an RTMP server.

### **Steps to Connect OBS Studio to an RTMP Server**

1. **Get the RTMP Server URL**
   - Typically in the format:
     ```
     rtmp://your-server-ip/live
     ```
2. **Configure OBS Studio**
   - Open **OBS Studio**
   - Go to **Settings > Stream**
   - Select **Custom** as the service
   - Enter the RTMP server URL
   - Set a **Stream Key** (e.g., `stream1`)
3. **Start Streaming**
   - Click **Start Streaming** in OBS
   - The RTMP server will now receive the video feed

ðŸ“Œ **Example RTMP URL and Stream Key in OBS:**

```
rtmp://your-server-ip/live
Stream Key: stream1
```

Once the RTMP server receives the stream, it can either distribute it directly to RTMP-compatible players or convert it into HLS for broader compatibility.

---

## **4. How RTMP Converts to HLS for Web Playback**

To make the stream playable in web browsers, the RTMP stream is converted into HLS:

1. **NGINX with RTMP Module receives the RTMP stream**

   - It listens for incoming streams and processes them.

2. **NGINX segments the RTMP stream into small `.ts` files**

   - These are typically 2-10 seconds long.

3. **An `.m3u8` playlist file is generated**

   - This file contains a list of `.ts` video segments and tells the media player how to play them.

4. **Users watch the stream via an HLS-compatible player**
   - Most web browsers, mobile devices, and video players (like VLC) support HLS.

ðŸ“Œ **Example HLS URL:**

```
http://your-server-ip/hls/stream1.m3u8
```

A web-based video player (like Video.js) can then be used to play the stream.

---

## **5. Key Takeaways**

- **RTMP** is great for low-latency streaming and is used to send video to media servers.
- **HLS** is better for compatibility and scalability but has higher latency.
- Streaming software like **OBS Studio** connects to an RTMP server, which then converts the stream to HLS for web playback.
- **NGINX with RTMP module** is commonly used for handling RTMP and converting it to HLS.
